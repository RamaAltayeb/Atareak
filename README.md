# What does this app do?
Atareak is a semi taxi mobile application.

Drivers and passengers are our main actors. whenever a driver is heading off to some place he can enter his trip data and it will be posted for the passengers to reserve a spot.

Suppose that an ordinary taxi ride costs 40 units (as in money). Furthermore our driver has 4 empty seats on his trip. Then, at that point, 4 passengers will book a 10 units ride with him rather than every one taking the 40 unit ride alone.

The driver will get payed for a trip he would make anyway - with or without passengers - and the passengers will save 30 units each. So it is a shared benefit.

Each time a trip is created the application suggests all potential routes for it, arranged by length and travel time, with the help of MapBox SDK.

Most important used libraries:
1- mapbox_gl (which was a tricky one to install).
2- mapbox_search_flutter (modified it myself to fit this project).
3- geolocator.
4- flutter_local_notifications.
5- workmanager.
6- Last but not least and my favorite the getx library.

I have also used linting rules to keep the code clean and follow the google standards.
